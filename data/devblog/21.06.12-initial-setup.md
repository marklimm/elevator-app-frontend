Created the repo, another review of my steps for bootstrapping a new nextjs project with typescript, sass, tailwind, eslint, prettier

Got a basic client-server connection going with socketio!  Testing broadcasting from the server to all clients and broadcasting to all clients except the one who sent the message.  One thing that I had to look out for was making sure that extra connections weren't being created when my react component would re-render
