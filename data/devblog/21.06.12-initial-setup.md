Created the repo, another review of my steps for bootstrapping a new nextjs project with typescript, sass, tailwind, eslint, prettier

Got a basic client-server connection going with socketio!  Testing broadcasting from the server to all clients and broadcasting to all clients except the one who sent the message.  One thing that I had to look out for was making sure that extra connections weren't being created when my react component would re-render

Deployed up the express backend and the frontend to vercel!  Specified the allowed cross-domain origin and it's working!  Always nice to deploy up to see if there's any unexpected issues with the deploy

Starting to work through how the "button pressed" client and server communication should happen.  I'm not sure if both the client and the server need to keep track of the same state.  Maybe the client only needs to display messages and know the current location of the elevator?
