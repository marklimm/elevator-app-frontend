Starting to work on a "game loop"/`setInterval()` that runs on the server-side and that asynchronous processes (the elevators) will refer to ... not entirely sure what I'm doing ...

Generating a random value within the loop and broadcasting that to all of the clients!  Splitting the functionality into different files

Setup eslint and standard linter rules in the nodejs/express app!

Added jest with typescript integration for backend unit tests

Using a Building class to store the shared state.  This is getting read from by (now 2) game loops and is getting set by various client action event listeners

Sending messages to the server to update the shared Building object

Starting to define a common protocol for messages between client/server

Using `async-lock` to put a lock around changing the shared state variables (that get read from multiple asynchronous processes which are the different browsers).  I thought there'd be more to this but it ended up being just wrapping the code with the lock
