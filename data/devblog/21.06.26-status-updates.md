Organizing the "game loops" into their own directory and state objects into their own directory

Starting to put together loops for (1) spawning a new user and (2) broadcasting status updates back to the web client.  Rendering out status updates on the web frontend.  Working on shaping what the architecture is going to look like

Starting to create a person status to distinguish between before they've made an elevator request and after they've made one, adding their request onto the "elevator request queue"

Removed a "status loop" that I created so that we only broadcast updates to the client when something has happened

Working with async code ... I think I have it so that multiple elevator requests can be processed on the same loop iteration

Starting to think through some fun elevator logic.  Maybe I'm writing this too early, but I don't think it really hurts to do it either

Sending down elevator updates separate from people updates

Got a basic test going to have the elevators move from the 1st floor to the 10th floor!

Starting to work on actually processing elevator requests off of the elevator request queue and determining which elevator should be chosen to handle the request!

Restructured my personLoop so that each individual person has their own interval/loop
