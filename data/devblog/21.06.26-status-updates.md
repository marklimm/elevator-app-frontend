Starting to put together loops for (1) spawning a new user and (2) broadcasting status updates back to the web client.  Rendering out status updates on the web frontend.  Working on shaping what the architecture is going to look like

Starting to create a person status to distinguish between before they've made an elevator request and after they've made one, adding their request onto the "elevator request queue"

Removed a "status loop" that I created so that we only broadcast updates to the client when something has happened
