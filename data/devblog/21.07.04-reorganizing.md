Consolidating person and elevator status update types.  Storing the person updates and elevator updates into separate typescript classes

Reorganizing the entire architecture of the backend so that it incorporates more typescript classes as well as the file structure.  A big part of this project is deciding where specifically certain classes should live and who should own what functions/functionality.  Experimenting with a `StateManager` class that holds all of the state, instead of state being stored in a module that can be referenced from everywhere
