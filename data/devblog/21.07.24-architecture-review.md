Broadcasting when the elevator is first ready and waiting to take a request

Fixed an error where I was attempting to get the same person lock twice.  This shows how it's more important to be organized when you're working with acquiring locks before the code runs

Renamed elevator status from "RECEIVED_REQUEST" to "TOOK_REQUEST" to be more specific

Reviewed application files, moved elevator and person broadcaster classes, adding comments

Starting to work on initiating spawning a new person from the client-side.  This is the first case of the client emitting a message to the server.  Ran into a crazy error where I'm passing more than 4 parameters to .bind() and typescript doesn't like this.  So this is making me think of ways to restructure how I call the interval loops

Ended up creating the PersonLoopCreator class to avoid passing multiple parameters into a function
