Broadcasting when the elevator is first ready and waiting to take a request

Fixed an error where I was attempting to get the same person lock twice.  This shows how it's more important to be organized when you're working with acquiring locks before the code runs

Renamed elevator status from "RECEIVED_REQUEST" to "TOOK_REQUEST" to be more specific

Reviewed application files, moved elevator and person broadcaster classes, adding comments
