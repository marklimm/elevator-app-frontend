Removing the loop that spawns new people because that doesn't translate as well when the app is deployed up to vercel.  New people will instead be spawned by user requests to the server

Creating the form to spawn a new person, including disabling the button using tailwind's `disabled` state, which has to be enabled in `tailwind.config.js`

Wrapping all of the update responses with a `status` of "ok" or "error" value and potentially an `error` message.  This allows for error messaging when an error occurs, right now I'm just using it to send an error response when the user is attempting to spawn too many people
