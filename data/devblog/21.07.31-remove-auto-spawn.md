Removing the loop that spawns new people because that doesn't translate as well when the app is deployed up to vercel.  New people will instead be spawned by user requests to the server

Creating the form to spawn a new person, including disabling the button using tailwind's `disabled` state, which has to be enabled in `tailwind.config.js`
