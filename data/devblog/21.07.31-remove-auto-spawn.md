Removing the loop that spawns new people because that doesn't translate as well when the app is deployed up to vercel.  New people will instead be spawned by user requests to the server

Creating the form to spawn a new person, including disabling the button using tailwind's `disabled` state, which has to be enabled in `tailwind.config.js`

Wrapping all of the update responses with a `status` of "ok" or "error" value and potentially an `error` message.  This allows for error messaging when an error occurs, right now I'm just using it to send an error response when the user is attempting to spawn too many people

Displaying an error message to the user if they attempt to spawn a new person when there are already too many people in the "building"

Pre-populating a randomly generated name for the new person to be spawned, so the user doesn't have to type in a name for the new person if they don't want to.  I ended up having to create a new custom hook `usePlaceholderName()` in order to support this, because it has to know which names are currently used to avoid choosing one of those already selected names
