Working on the part where the elevator opens its doors to the person.  But the elevator has to "know" which direction the user wants to go before it opens its doors (so that the "lights above the elevator" correctly light up that the elevator is going UP or DOWN to match the user's destination floor).  Interesting the elevator logic that's involved
