Elevator taking the person.  Running into a question of where the locks for the array of elevators and array of people should be handled vs. the locks for individual elevators and individual persons.  

Seems like I'm making smooth progress on the steps of "elevator opens doors", "person enters elevator" and "person presses button".  I need to make the creation of the update paylods more DRY (don't repeat yourself) because all the updates seem to have the exact same information pretty much (with the Elevator/Person status changing and then passing in the people and elevator)
