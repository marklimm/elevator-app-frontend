Displaying the person updates within a 3-column grid

Renamed the concept of "removing a person from the app" to "unspawn-ing a person", because a person can "re-spawn" and have the updates from their 2nd elevator ride appended onto the updates from their first ride

Updated the version of nextjs and typescript.  react and react-dom are already up to date
